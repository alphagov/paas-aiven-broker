This is an [Open Service Broker API](https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org/) compliant service broker for services offered by [https://aiven.io/](https://aiven.io/).

## Running

Provide a configuration file, such as the example configuration, and run `main`:

```bash
go run main.go -config examples/config.json
```

## Testing

For unit testing run:

```bash
make unit
```

For integration testing you need to set environment variables (see [`provider/config.go`](https://github.com/alphagov/paas-aiven-broker/blob/8de53e8afb047edf47b8d5bf17b4105dc1507dc6/provider/config.go#L70-L90) for details) and run:

```bash
make integration
```

Note: integration testing uses the real Aiven API and therefore incurs a cost.
